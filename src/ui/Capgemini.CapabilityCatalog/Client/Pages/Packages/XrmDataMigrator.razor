<h3>XRM Data Migrator</h3>

<p>
    This Data Migration project provides a flexible powerful engine based on the XRM SDK which allows CRM Dynamics Configuration, 
    Reference and Seed data to be extracted, stored in version control and loaded to target instances. The engine supports two file 
    formats JSON and CSV and supports the migration of simple reference data entities (e.g. Titles, Countries) to more complex scenarios 
    around Security Roles and Teams. This allows data to be managed in the same way as code and a release can be created that can load the 
    required data to support the released functionality.
